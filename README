## HMT Cycling proof of concept project

This repository consists of the open data and scripts we used for the HMT cycling project.
The main dataset used:
- National statistics
- CyIPT
- CyIPT Rapid

The large source data files (json, geojson and csv) are managed with [git-lfs extension](https://git-lfs.github.com/).

This script codes are not optimised and are not actively maintained.

### environment.sh
To upload code to Elastic cloud service, you need to create an 'environment.sh' file locally containing these variables
export CLOUD_ID={{your elastic cloud id}}
export API_KEY_1={{part 1 of the api key}}
export API_KEY_2={{part 2 of the api key}}

### List of scripts:
- download-from-cyipt-api-upload-directly.py
This is a script written in Python to download data from CyIPT using API directly (with consideration of CyIPT rate limiting). The data is downloaded as json and upload to Elastic cluster directly.

- load_to_elastic.py
This is a script to load geojson map data to an elastic index.


### Note of csv files
CSV files in the data folder are loaded to Elastic via the GUI (Machine learning/ file upload)
